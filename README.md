# Divisibility-test
A small project to test whether a number is odd, prime or even. 
it is used to obtain all factors of a number provided the number is less than 200.
It shows the factors of any number but not those above 200. The number may be above 200, but that only means other factors may be left out. including the number itself.
Yes this project is for educational purpose only and never intended to be branded.
